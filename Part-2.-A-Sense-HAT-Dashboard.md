![Sense HAT + Dashboard](https://github.com/InitialState/wunderground-sensehat/wiki/img/sensehat_data.png)

Let's test our Sense HAT to make sure everything is working. We will use the script located at https://github.com/InitialState/wunderground-sensehat/blob/master/sensehat.py. You can copy this script to a file on your Pi or access it from our Github repository that we cloned earlier. Change into your wunderground-sensehat directory and then nano into your sensehat.py file by typing:

    $ nano sensehat.py


Notice on the first line that we are importing the SenseHat library into the script. Before you run this script, we need to setup our user parameters. 

```
# --------- User Settings ---------
CITY = "Nashville"
BUCKET_NAME = ":partly_sunny: " + CITY + " Weather"
BUCKET_KEY = "sensehat"
ACCESS_KEY = "Your_Access_Key"
SENSOR_LOCATION_NAME = "Office"
MINUTES_BETWEEN_SENSEHAT_READS = 0.1
# ---------------------------------
```

Specifically, you need to set your ACCESS_KEY to your Initial State account access key. Notice how easy it is to read data from the Sense HAT in a single line of Python (e.g. sense.get_temperature()).  

At a command prompt on your Pi, run the script:

```
$ sudo python sensehat.py
```

Go to your Initial State account and view the new data bucket created by the Sense HAT.

We are ready to put it all together and create our hyper-local weather dashboard.
