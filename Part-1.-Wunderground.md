The Weather Underground (http://www.wunderground.com) provides real-time online weather information assisted by a network 140,000+ personal weather stations setup all over the world. Chances are, there is a Weather Underground personal weather station near you. The really cool aspect of Wunderground is that they have an [API](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface) that we can use to retrieve the weather data (pretty much) any where in the world.  

Temperature, dew point, wind gust, humidity, precipitation, pressure, UV index, ... all easily available for wherever we want, whenever we want. Let's learn how to use Wunderground's super-simple API.
