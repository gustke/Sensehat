Now for the fun part. We are ready to start using the Wunderground API to create a weather dashboard and capture the weather history for wherever we choose.  To do this, we are going to use the Python script:
https://github.com/InitialState/wunderground-sensehat/blob/master/wunderground.py. This script simply calls the Wunderground API using your API key and retrieves the weather information on a specified time interval. It also streams that data to your Initial State account, which will allow you to create a Wunderground dashboard.

Copy this script to your Pi. Before you run it, you need to set your desired parameters and insert your keys. Edit the section near the top of the script:

```
# --------- User Settings ---------
STATE = "CA"
CITY = "San_Francisco"
WUNDERGROUND_API_KEY = "PLACE YOUR WUNDERGROUND API KEY HERE"
BUCKET_NAME = ":partly_sunny: " + CITY + " Weather"
BUCKET_KEY = "wu1"
ACCESS_KEY = "PLACE YOUR INITIAL STATE ACCESS KEY HERE"
MINUTES_BETWEEN_READS = 15
# ---------------------------------
```

You need to set the desired state and city. You also have to insert your Wunderground API key and your Initial State account access key or your data isn't going to go anywhere. The MINUTES_BETWEEN_READS parameter will set how often your script will poll the Wunderground API for weather information. 15 minutes provides a nice interval long-term. For the sake of short-term testing, you can set this to 0.5 minutes.

Once you have your parameters set, you are ready to run your script:

```
$ python wunderground.py
```

If you are ssh'ing into your Pi and want to leave this script running uninterrupted for a long time, you can use the nohup command (no hang-up) as follows:

```
$ nohup python wunderground.py &
```

This script is going to do a bit more than just read the weather data and send it to Initial State. This script is going to take advantage of the emoji support built into Initial State's tools to make the dashboard a bit more sexy. You can see the logic used to take the weather status from the current_observation -> icon status and convert it to an emoji token in the weather_icon function. Something similar happens for the moon phase in the moon_icon function and wind direction in the wind_dir_icon function.

Go to your Initial State account and look at your data. The screenshot of the dashboard above was taken after 9 days of data collection running at 15 minute intervals. You can edit your dashboard by changing chart types with the cog icon in the top right corner of each tile and by right-clicking on a tile to resize/move it around.

The next step in this project is to start collecting weather data from our own sensors.
