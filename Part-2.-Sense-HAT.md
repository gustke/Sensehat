![Sense HAT + Dashboard](https://github.com/InitialState/wunderground-sensehat/wiki/img/sensehat.jpg)

The [Sense HAT](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/sense-hat/) is an add-on board for the Raspberry Pi that is full of sensors, LEDs, and a tiny joystick. It costs $30 and you can get it from places like http://www.mcmelectronics.com and http://www.element14.com. What is so great about this little add-on is that it is incredibly easy to install and use thanks to a fantastic Python library that you can quickly install. For this project, we will use the temperature, humidity, and barometric pressure sensors on the Sense HAT. Let's set it up.
